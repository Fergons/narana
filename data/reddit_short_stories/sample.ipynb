       "[Story(_id=5, text='I\\'ve seen a lot of tens. It\\'s scary, really, how quickly people can go from six or even five to ten. Other people don\\'t realize how much danger surrounds them every day. It takes so little...\\nNo, the tens aren\\'t the ones that stay with you. Not for long, anyway. No, the one that will always be in my mind was something else entirely.\\nA zero.\\nShe was the first zero I ever saw, and the only one until I watched my children be born. They eventually grew into little ones and twos, of course, but for a short, wonderful time, they were tiny, giggling bundles of zero. But I\\'m getting ahead of myself.\\n*She* was the first. Sarah. I was drawn to her from the moment I saw her, dangling her legs from a swing on the playground. How old could we have been? 12? 13, maybe. I wasn\\'t really sure what the numbers meant then, but the lowest I\\'d ever seen was a one, so I knew she was something special. I stared at her from across the playground and she smiled at me, her entire face beaming zero. I\\'m telling you... they say Helen of Troy had a face that launched a thousand ships. Well, Sarah could make them come back home. If there ever was a face that could end wars, it was hers.\\nWe were friends at first. I was terrified of ruining it by saying too much, but the words I wanted to say ran laps through my head every time I saw her. Then, on a hot summer night that was made for drunken mistakes, I said them anyway. And guess what? She felt the same way.\\nWhen I think about my kids, I don\\'t want them to be rich. I don\\'t want them to be famous. I just want them to feel what I felt back there on that summer night, because I know that if they find someone to share that moment with, they\\'ll be happy for the rest of their lives.\\nWhere was I? Oh, yeah. After that night, me and Sarah were one. We went through the rest of high school. College. We got married and got nice jobs. Bought a house. Got kids. Everything was perfect... for a while.\\nSomething was going on with Sarah. I first noticed it one Saturday morning when she was doing the laundry. She\\'d been doing long hours at work all week and wasn\\'t feeling very well, so I offered to do the laundry. She looked up at me then and smiled faintly, but something was off. Instead of the clear, bright zero I was so used to seeing, she was flashing a faint one. The next moment, she was back to zero. I was stunned at first, but managed to convince myself it was nothing. She\\'d had a tough week, that was all.\\nThe next time, we were having dinner with the kids. She wasn\\'t behaving like her usual self, and she gave off a dull, weak three, like she was trying desperately to calm down. When I asked her if something was wrong, she mumbled something about an asshole at work. I wanted to dig deeper, but I had to take care of the kids. I asked her again later, but she clammed up completely. Everything about it was so unlike her.\\nI racked my brain for weeks trying to find out what was wrong. Was it something I\\'d done? Was she about to get fired? And the unthinkable: was she sick? But why wouldn\\'t she tell me? I thought we had no secrets. I\\'d always told her everything! Well... apart from the numbers. She\\'d think I was mad.\\nThen, one day, I found out the truth.\\nIt was early Friday morning. She never came home Thursday night. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling and running the same thoughts over and over through my mind. Imagining the worst. Was I going to get a call from the police? The hospital? I considered calling them to see if she was there.\\nI heard a car pull up at our driveway. I didn\\'t have to look; it was her. I listened to her opening the door. Taking off her shoes, walking up the stairs - was something off about her steps? - putting her hand on the door handle. In the dead silence, I heard her take a deep breath on the other side. The door clicked and swung open, and there she was.\\nShe\\'d been crying. She wore her work clothes, but they were a bit ruffled and wrinkly. She looked at me with an expression I\\'d never seen her wear before. Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks. She drew another breath, short and shallow, and her lips slowly parted.\\n\"We need to talk.\"\\nHer voice sounded muffled in my ears, like it was coming from far away. From someone else. She remained in the doorway, not saying a word. I didn\\'t either. I just looked at her. *Sarah*. There she was, standing in our bedroom on the second floor of our house. In the rooms across the hall, our children were sleeping.\\nI watched her standing there, and she looked back at me, her face screaming a hot, burning ten.\\n'),\n",
       " Story(_id=6, text='\"You\\'re *pun*der arrest! You have the right to remain silent,\" I told him as I man-handled him into the back of the police cruiser. \"Everything you say can and will be used against you to make puns.\" We\\'d had to make a few little tweaks to the Miranda warning ever since bad jokes became physically hurtful.\\n\"I didn\\'t do nothing!\" he shouted at me as I got back into the driver\\'s seat. They always ignore the warning, don\\'t they?\\n\"Well sounds like Nothing is a lucky gal,\" I replied. He winced and rolled his eyes, but I was just getting started. Dad Jokes were just an appetizer in the meal I was about to serve him. I fumbled around at my seatbelt, making exaggerated sounds of frustration until he stopped complaining. Finally, I managed to get it on. \"Sorry for the delay,\" I told him. \"I couldn\\'t figure it out, and then it just clicked.\"\\nHe gripped the barrier between us and shook it violently, gritting his teeth.\\n\"You should have stopped when we told you. High speed chases never work out for the criminals. I would not... **wreck**-amend it!\"\\nHe rolled in agony, struggling against his handcuffs to cover his ears.\\n\"And the end of the crash, when you clipped that billboard? So ominous!\"\\nHe managed to open his eyes, which had been screwed tight. \"What?\"\\n\"Ominous,\" I repeated. He grimaced at me, only just realizing what was about to happen.\\n\"Because now it\\'s a bad sign!\"\\n\"*Fuck*\" he whispered to himself. Walked right into that one....\\nHe\\'d had enough for now. Time to call this one in.\\n\"This is Officer Rodriguez... After *combing* the area for that wig thief, high speed pursuit had ended and the victim is in custody. I am bringing him in now. Time to undergo mitosis, because we\\'re going to need another cell!\"\\nThe radio crackled to life.\\n\"Damnit, Rodriguez... how many times have we told you not to to do that over the radio?\"\\n\"Sorry, sir. I must have been abducted or something.\" I had the bad misfortune to enjoy my job a little too much. No reason to subject the other officers to that torture. But I couldn\\'t help but smile...\\n\"...abducted?\" asked the other officer over the radio.\\n\"No, don\\'t!\" yelled the criminal from the backseat. But the radio wasn\\'t transmitting; they couldn\\'t hear him.\\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Because I got carried away...\"\\n'),\n",

I can --\"\\nMr. Brock throws a cardboard box my way. \"We have nothing more to talk about, Jason.\"\\nHe turns around and steps away, heading for his big office with his big window and his big trophies.\\nLittle by little, the heads start lowering back to their computers.

No pictures of the wife. No macaroni pen holder.\\nI don\\'t have a lot of stuff to show for, in this life.\\nI put the last of my action figures (John Constantine, from Hellblazer) on the box and I get up, sniffing.\\n\"Well...

       " Story(_id=8, text='A coincidence is always possible, but only a fool would have jotted this down under \"luck.\"\\nWhen I left the police station my head was still spinning. One of the cops said I was lucky to still have a head, but I thought he wasn\\'t giving me enough credit. The bulldozer was coming for my legs first, I\\'d at least have swung my torso out of the way.\\nThe construction workers were, of course, apologetic, and I had noticed the site at least a month before -- a new store, or something, going up, so they\\'d brought in the heavy equipment. Really it had never occurred to me that it would become so dangerous, or I\\'d have walked on the other side.\\nThey assured me two and three times over that it was very, very rare for a piece of equipment to get out of control like that, let alone go careening for the sidewalk. To be fair, I was almost more embarrassed than they were. I\\'m usually a pretty fast guy, and it was only because I was tripped up by a garbage can that I ended up in the path of the dozer.\\nAt any rate, I was still alive, so the focus on me didn\\'t last long. Eventually all the involved parties -- the cops, the construction workers, some witnesses (and me, trapped doing paperwork) -- were gathered in the lobby of the police station a few blocks down. The squirrel had captured everyone\\'s imagination.\\nI\\'d just assumed someone had hopped back in the dozer and swerved into the road before it got to me, but the workers testified that they\\'d come nowhere close to it. Jimmy, the guy who\\'d left it going, never reached it. But the dozer had obviously changed direction, and they were all wondering whether the squirrel that had hopped out of the cockpit had had anything to do with it.\\nI had nothing to say about it, and left the station as soon as they\\'d let me. Even though they said their agency would call I doubted that I\\'d be getting back to them.\\nI took the other side of the street on the way back. Of course I\\'d seen the squirrel too, but I\\'d seen it last. To me it seemed like the squirrel had climbed out of one of the city trees and scampered away after the commotion. But deep down I knew there was more, because when the squirrel got to the end of the block he paused and looked straight at me. Rearing up, he stood as tall as he could and -- curse my poor eyesight -- almost looked to be raising a paw in the air with an attitude that implied goodbye. I rose when I saw him and from a higher angle I saw that the gesture was being delivered almost with reverence. Then he bowed against the concrete, and the windless summer day presented him flat against the earth. Hot and still. If a squirrel had lain like that a few feet back -- in the road -- it would\\'ve been mistaken for roadkill.\\nI was quickening my pace away from the sidewalk scene. I knew I\\'d seen the squirrel before, but a torrent of tears came to me at the same time. I\\'d seen many squirrels before the bumper of my car and it was this one -- only this one alone -- who\\'d made it.\\n'),\n",

None of those planets held any life beyond the hostile and untamable, nor any blunts to blaze upon. It was truly us against them; however, we wish to make it clear that we do have blood on our hands.
