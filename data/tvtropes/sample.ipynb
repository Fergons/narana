       " In some of the novels, Bernardo also wears the Zorro costume in order to distract and mislead pursuers. Bernardo has also been known to play the part of Zorro to divert suspicion from Diego while he has an alibi (such as being imprisoned or questioned on suspicion of being Zorro). Zorro's friend and sometimes love interest/accomplice Lolita Pulido has also donned the mask.  In Isabel Allende's novel Diego has a second Zorro outfit and sword made for Bernardo to throw villains for a loop, and Isabel de Romeu butts in with Bernardo's Zorro costume when the villain is smart enough to have both Diego imprisoned and his men keep an eye on Bernardo in case he donned the Zorro outfit. The epilogue makes clear that in the end Diego is the main Zorro, but both Bernardo and Isabel would wear his costume if needed and can kick just as much ass as him.  In  Zorro, the Gay Blade , Don Diego and his brother Ramon both are Zorro. The brothers' father was too, although he's deceased at the time of the movie.  In  The Mask of Zorro , Anthony Hopkins plays the original Zorro (Don Diego de la Vega) and Antonio Banderas is his trainee  and later son-in-law , Alejandro.  In the 1997 animated series Diego de la Vega was not the first Zorro, but the original was unknown and shrowded in legend.  The brief TV Series  Zorro and Son  was actually  about  an older Don Diego training his son, Don Carlos, to take his place.  In one of the animated series episodes a soldier is about to be executed upon suspicion of being Zorro, when Zorro himself intervenes and frees him. The soldier in gratitude  also  assumes the identity of Zorro in another part of old California, so in this continuity there ends up being  two Zorros  at work in different places, thus reinforcing the secret identity of both.
