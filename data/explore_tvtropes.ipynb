The Sick Land is a giant example of this trope.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Real Life\\xa0 Several of Walt Disney World\\'s theme park projects were scuttled due to external factors, and instead of dismantling the sites for good, the corporation often chose to vacate without removing the original architecture. As a result, the various sites have become favored sites for urban explorers to discover and document: Following the resort\\'s opening in 1971, there were plans to build three more hotels around the Seven Seas Lagoon to complement the Polynesian and Contemporary Resorts. Land was cleared for the Asian Resort, which was aiming for a 1974 opening, but construction was abruptly cancelled due to Disney losing tourism money as a result of the 1973-74 oil crisis. The site stood empty for more than a decade until the Grand Floridian Resort opened on that spot in 1988. \"Discovery Island\", a small inlet just across the river from the Magic Kingdom, opened in 1974 and housed a wide selection of exotic animals and birds. When the animals were moved to Animal Kingdom in 1999, the island was shuttered and sits abandoned and overgrown with various plant species. It has also been rumored that the park was closed because the water around the island was contaminated with brain-eating amoeba. The Pop Century Resort Hotel spent more than a decade being unused and unfinished after construction on the project was halted due to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The site was eventually completed and opened as the Art of Animation Resort in 2012. WDW\\'s original waterpark, \"River Country\". Most of the attractions centered around a beach on the shores of Bay Lake and there was only one treated swimming pool in the park. Due to competition from the much larger parks Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach, as well as a Florida Law requiring water parks to use filtered water, the park shut down in 2001 and left untouched, making for an unusual blight in the middle of Walt Disney World\\'s spectacle. The shower building and ticket booth were used by the neighboring Fort Wilderness campground, and only a fence separated guests from the stagnant upstream plunge pool. In 2018 Disney announced plans to build a new hotel on the site and demolition of \"River Country\" followed in April 2019. \"Treasure Island\", built in the Bahamas and intended to be a major tourist attraction. The site was scuttled when attempts to re-dredge the site after the area around the island became shallow failed, and they simply packed up and left the site to be pillaged by vandals. Haikyo refer to \"ruins\" in Japanese, specifically, ruins and abandonments from the modern era. Some of the haikyo are a relic of the Japanese Economic Bubble, which, during the 1980s, led to an era of growth, and companies expanded and built in the hopes of capitalising on the profit, but since the bubble burst, the financial strains of these projects meant that they were no longer viable. Demolishing these facilities were also costly, so they are just left behind to be reclaimed by mother nature. There are other haikyo in Japan arising from the end of a mining era; once newer resources and mechanisms were developed, the need for older mines and factories disappeared. \\'Haikyoing\\' is the act of exploring these old ruins, and is something of a popular hobby in Japan, although as with most urban exploration endeavors, a degree of risk is present, whether it be laws, structural stability, and the like. A somewhat unusual example is the Tama Hills Recreation Area, a former munitions factory and arsenal used by the Japanese during World War II which was cleaned out, mostly-torn-down, and turned into a golf course and campground for the US military. While it is certainly not abandoned (it\\'s quite popular as a weekend getaway), bits and pieces of its former life remain, in the form of overgrown smokestacks, concrete walls and bunkers, and abandoned buildings scattered around. High on the list of places urban explorers visit. The legality and safety of such is debatable, as abandoned buildings tend to be still privately owned and covered in pigeon poo, syringes, or both. Pripyat, Ukraine, a worker town for the Chernobyl Power Plant about eighty miles from Kyiv, and evacuated after the Chernobyl disaster. It\\'s more or less a perfectly preserved Soviet ghost town. You can actually visit it under supervision, but you wouldn\\'t want to live there. The picture on this page is from the amusement park in Pripyat. The entire Chernobyl Exclusion zone also counts. Centralia, Pennsylvania, evacuated due to a massive underground coal fire, which has been described as \"the real-life Silent Hill\". The Six Flags park in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. It was scheduled to be torn down on January 2011, but those plans have since fallen through, so it still stands today, empty and creepy as fuck. In 2012, it served as a filming location for Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters and parts of it were cleaned up and some of the rides were re-wired to light up and have since fallen into an even worse state. The \"lost theme park\" Splendid China, in Kissimmee, Florida, which went out of business in 2003, is now an \"attraction\" for local skateboarders who brave potential arrests for trespassing in order to skate in the abandoned park. Dead malls are a subversion of this. A dead mall is a mall in which huge majority of the store spaces are unoccupied and there are very few patrons (if any), but the mall is technically open for business. One filmmaker, Dan Bell, even has an entire series chronicling dead malls he has found throughout the country, some of which are legitimately abandoned and boarded up. The Ur-Example is Dixie Square Mall in Harvey, Illinois. After only a decade and a half in business, the mall closed and a year later it was used for the Mall chase scene in The Blues Brothers, and then it was left to rot for 33 years before finally being demolished in 2012. Despite a police station being built across the street, it was a very high crime area and the site of several rapes and even a murder, which sealed its fate of never being reopened. A number of residents of Harvey even tried to sue John Landis for $75,000 for failing to make good on promises of reopening the Dixie Square Mall, which he never made. The suit was thrown out of court. One of the most extreme versions of this is the New South China Mall. It\\'s one of the largest malls in the entire world, with 2300 store spaces and amusement park-like attractions such as a roller coaster and a replica of Venice...yet fewer than 20 store spaces are in use and patronage is abysmal to the point where photos of it give the impression that the mall is closed for good. Rolling Acres Mall in Akron, Ohio sat abandoned for close to a decade, and numerous attempts to demolish the property had been stalled due to a lack of buyers and a complicated rights battle with a largely-defunct real estate developer. The site, which closed in 2008, was a frequent target for urban explorers, resulted in at least one known suicide outside the mall itself, was the burial site for the three victims of a pair of serial killers, and was subject to strange weather-related events inside the mall itself (either from plants that have become overgrown or snow that has fallen inside of the mall due to the skylights being broken). After a long, drawn-out process, the city of Akron finally seized control of the property and tore it down by the end of 2017 — this didn\\'t stop people from breaking in again and taking tours of the site during demolition. The Ambassador Hotel In Los Angeles (notorious for being the location of Robert F. Kennedy\\'s assassination), despite enjoying a very active afterlife as a movie set for various films and TV shows, still steadily decayed for two decades to the point where spores grew through the floor and carpets. Ironically, its final role was a younger version of itself in the Day-in-the-life movie Bobby, even as it was being demolished. Forgotten Ohio is filled with pictures of abandoned locales within the state of Ohio that the author has paid visits to. They run the gamut from factories, warehouses, and schools to ghost towns, drive-in theaters, and weird houses. Unsurprisingly, these places usually come with ghost legends. Varosha, a quarter of Famagusta on the island of Cyprus. Formerly one of the top resorts in the world, it remained in Turkish hands following Turkey\\'s 1974 invasion of the island, but a UN resolution forbids them from populating it. Only the Turkish military and UN officials are allowed in, and it is tightly guarded, so unlike most abandoned places, it\\'s relatively untouched by urban explorers and vandals. The Fair Company department store in the small town of Union Springs, Alabama. The owners retired in 1992 and, unable to find someone to take over the store, just closed it one summer day, leaving all the merchandise inside. More than 20 years later, it\\'s still abandoned, with everything inside completely intact. Frequently, when a farmer moves off their land, their neighbors will buy them out to extend their crop yield, but do nothing with the buildings left behind. More than a dozen New York City Subway stations and portions of existing stations have been closed and left to rot for several reasons: the MTA\\'s unwillingness to maintain the station, low patronage, and track alterations that rendered portions of a line unusable. Many urban planners view the city-owned Independent Subway System to be inundated with many exits and mezzanines unnecessarily built; some of them were built in anticipation of future expansions that weren\\'t built. Plus, many of the old elevateds were removed because their route was essentially duplicated by a nearby subway line and/or were seen as blighted. Also, while discussion remains strong to this day for the subway\\'s expansion, many of the provisions have largely been ignored due to funding problems or political bickering. Similarly, there are quite a few unused and abandoned stations on the London Underground. Since 2014, the town of Picher, Oklahoma has been officially classified as an abandoned town. Due to a half-century\\'s worth of devastating natural incidents (including, but not limited to, mine cave-ins, toxic contaminants that were kept in piles next to public spaces, groundwater contamination, a massive spike in negative health effects, possible permanent damage due to long-term lead inhalation, and a tornado), the city underwent a forced evacuation in 2006, with most of the remaining residents fleeing after said tornado touched down in 2008. The last surviving resident (and town pharmacist), Gary Linderman, passed away in 2015, and the site has been officially earmarked for future cleanup by the Environmental Protection Association. As it currently stands, though, Picher is uninhabitable and many of its buildings are left in serious disrepair. Countless Drive In Theaters have been left reasonably untouched since their decline in the 1970s and 1980s, and in many cases (particularly in smaller towns), the fixtures have been largely intact. It\\'s not unheard of to find a drive-in \"graveyard\" where the snack bar/projection booth or even the screen is still standing, despite having not been used for a long period of time. In 1968, the Pennsylvania Turnpike was rerouted east of Breezewood, PA in order to bypass the Ray\\'s Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels, two narrow tunnels that created traffic backups. This left a 13-mile stretch of old turnpike abandoned to public use, but still visible to this day. Part of the old turnpike became part of the interchange into Breezewood, which makes an abrupt left turn just before a long since abandoned bridge. The abandoned stretch also includes Cove Valley Travel Plaza, a rest area serving westbound travelers which was torn down after its abandonment. A third tunnel, the Laurel Hill Tunnel west of Somerset, PA, was also bypassed due to traffic demands but remains visible. Six Gun City or as it was last known Fort Jefferson in northern New Hampshire is completely abandoned and overgrown. Even creepier is the fact that the still open Santa\\'s Village is a stone\\'s throw away down the road. No effort has been made to remove anything and all the rides are mostly intact.This town is coming like a ghost town...Sally Sparrow: I love old things. They make me feel sad. Kathy Nightingale: What\\'s good about feeling sad? Sally: It\\'s like happy for deep people.— Doctor Who, \"Blink\"Advertisement:Abandoned places make good settings for fiction.

In The President several places of the fictional country of Riaveé are often turned in a battle field, and since abandoned place are preferred it turn out to stay abandoned once targeted. In Project 0 Owen\\'s lives in a hangar by the Machine Graveyard which is a supermassive abandoned airfield / junkyard fusion. In Roza while chasing a thief. In Shifters there are several examples of this trope. Many sections of The Undercity (beneath the [1] where the comic is set, which also qualify as the subtrope Ghost Cities, as well as anywhere effected by the \"Nuclear Incident\" that gave rise to the Mega City themselves.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Web Original\\xa0 The Creepypasta Abandoned by Disney documents an exploration of a fictional Disney resort known as Mowgli\\'s Palace (inspired by the real-life abandoned Treasure Island Bahamas resort, see real-life section below), with the Cruel Twist Ending of the park being haunted. The sequel, Room Zero documents a forbidden area of the Disneyland park that was a bomb shelter  where about 1000 people were Buried Alive when someone accidentally tripped an air raid siren one day in 1943. The patrons were herded into the shelter, then a power outage caused them all to suffocate. The Chronicles of Taras begins its second act in a ravaged, underground mall from the 1950s. http://www.deadmalls.com/ documents abandoned, dead, and dying shopping malls. On that note, remember that fun mall chase scene from The Blues Brothers? This is that mall 30+ years later. Scenery Gorn doesn\\'t even begin to describe it. Urban exploration is the main focus of The Proper People, making this a given. The SCP Foundation has SCP-470, an abandoned building that connects to every indoor abandoned location, including places that aren\\'t on Earth or even from our reality. SCP-823 is an abandoned amusement park which was abandoned after a bizarre event where 231 attendees were killed in bizarre accidents including, but not limited to: bizarre decapitations, dismembered bodies in the hall of mirrors, a person launched into the ground from a roller-coaster, and a couple fused together after exiting the tunnel of love deceased. The Sick Land is a giant example of this trope.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Real Life\\xa0 Several of Walt Disney World\\'s theme park projects were scuttled due to external factors, and instead of dismantling the sites for good, the corporation often chose to vacate without removing the original architecture. As a result, the various sites have become favored sites for urban explorers to discover and document: Following the resort\\'s opening in 1971, there were plans to build three more hotels around the Seven Seas Lagoon to complement the Polynesian and Contemporary Resorts. Land was cleared for the Asian Resort, which was aiming for a 1974 opening, but construction was abruptly cancelled due to Disney losing tourism money as a result of the 1973-74 oil crisis. The site stood empty for more than a decade until the Grand Floridian Resort opened on that spot in 1988. \"Discovery Island\", a small inlet just across the river from the Magic Kingdom, opened in 1974 and housed a wide selection of exotic animals and birds. When the animals were moved to Animal Kingdom in 1999, the island was shuttered and sits abandoned and overgrown with various plant species. It has also been rumored that the park was closed because the water around the island was contaminated with brain-eating amoeba. The Pop Century Resort Hotel spent more than a decade being unused and unfinished after construction on the project was halted due to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The site was eventually completed and opened as the Art of Animation Resort in 2012. WDW\\'s original waterpark, \"River Country\". Most of the attractions centered around a beach on the shores of Bay Lake and there was only one treated swimming pool in the park. Due to competition from the much larger parks Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach, as well as a Florida Law requiring water parks to use filtered water, the park shut down in 2001 and left untouched, making for an unusual blight in the middle of Walt Disney World\\'s spectacle. The shower building and ticket booth were used by the neighboring Fort Wilderness campground, and only a fence separated guests from the stagnant upstream plunge pool. In 2018 Disney announced plans to build a new hotel on the site and demolition of \"River Country\" followed in April 2019. \"Treasure Island\", built in the Bahamas and intended to be a major tourist attraction. The site was scuttled when attempts to re-dredge the site after the area around the island became shallow failed, and they simply packed up and left the site to be pillaged by vandals. Haikyo refer to \"ruins\" in Japanese, specifically, ruins and abandonments from the modern era. Some of the haikyo are a relic of the Japanese Economic Bubble, which, during the 1980s, led to an era of growth, and companies expanded and built in the hopes of capitalising on the profit, but since the bubble burst, the financial strains of these projects meant that they were no longer viable. Demolishing these facilities were also costly, so they are just left behind to be reclaimed by mother nature. There are other haikyo in Japan arising from the end of a mining era; once newer resources and mechanisms were developed, the need for older mines and factories disappeared. \\'Haikyoing\\' is the act of exploring these old ruins, and is something of a popular hobby in Japan, although as with most urban exploration endeavors, a degree of risk is present, whether it be laws, structural stability, and the like. A somewhat unusual example is the Tama Hills Recreation Area, a former munitions factory and arsenal used by the Japanese during World War II which was cleaned out, mostly-torn-down, and turned into a golf course and campground for the US military. While it is certainly not abandoned (it\\'s quite popular as a weekend getaway), bits and pieces of its former life remain, in the form of overgrown smokestacks, concrete walls and bunkers, and abandoned buildings scattered around. High on the list of places urban explorers visit. The legality and safety of such is debatable, as abandoned buildings tend to be still privately owned and covered in pigeon poo, syringes, or both. Pripyat, Ukraine, a worker town for the Chernobyl Power Plant about eighty miles from Kyiv, and evacuated after the Chernobyl disaster. It\\'s more or less a perfectly preserved Soviet ghost town. You can actually visit it under supervision, but you wouldn\\'t want to live there. The picture on this page is from the amusement park in Pripyat. The entire Chernobyl Exclusion zone also counts. Centralia, Pennsylvania, evacuated due to a massive underground coal fire, which has been described as \"the real-life Silent Hill\". The Six Flags park in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. It was scheduled to be torn down on January 2011, but those plans have since fallen through, so it still stands today, empty and creepy as fuck. In 2012, it served as a filming location for Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters and parts of it were cleaned up and some of the rides were re-wired to light up and have since fallen into an even worse state. The \"lost theme park\" Splendid China, in Kissimmee, Florida, which went out of business in 2003, is now an \"attraction\" for local skateboarders who brave potential arrests for trespassing in order to skate in the abandoned park. Dead malls are a subversion of this. A dead mall is a mall in which huge majority of the store spaces are unoccupied and there are very few patrons (if any), but the mall is technically open for business. One filmmaker, Dan Bell, even has an entire series chronicling dead malls he has found throughout the country, some of which are legitimately abandoned and boarded up. The Ur-Example is Dixie Square Mall in Harvey, Illinois. After only a decade and a half in business, the mall closed and a year later it was used for the Mall chase scene in The Blues Brothers, and then it was left to rot for 33 years before finally being demolished in 2012. Despite a police station being built across the street, it was a very high crime area and the site of several rapes and even a murder, which sealed its fate of never being reopened. A number of residents of Harvey even tried to sue John Landis for $75,000 for failing to make good on promises of reopening the Dixie Square Mall, which he never made. The suit was thrown out of court. One of the most extreme versions of this is the New South China Mall. It\\'s one of the largest malls in the entire world, with 2300 store spaces and amusement park-like attractions such as a roller coaster and a replica of Venice...yet fewer than 20 store spaces are in use and patronage is abysmal to the point where photos of it give the impression that the mall is closed for good. Rolling Acres Mall in Akron, Ohio sat abandoned for close to a decade, and numerous attempts to demolish the property had been stalled due to a lack of buyers and a complicated rights battle with a largely-defunct real estate developer. The site, which closed in 2008, was a frequent target for urban explorers, resulted in at least one known suicide outside the mall itself, was the burial site for the three victims of a pair of serial killers, and was subject to strange weather-related events inside the mall itself (either from plants that have become overgrown or snow that has fallen inside of the mall due to the skylights being broken). After a long, drawn-out process, the city of Akron finally seized control of the property and tore it down by the end of 2017 — this didn\\'t stop people from breaking in again and taking tours of the site during demolition. The Ambassador Hotel In Los Angeles (notorious for being the location of Robert F. Kennedy\\'s assassination), despite enjoying a very active afterlife as a movie set for various films and TV shows, still steadily decayed for two decades to the point where spores grew through the floor and carpets. Ironically, its final role was a younger version of itself in the Day-in-the-life movie Bobby, even as it was being demolished. Forgotten Ohio is filled with pictures of abandoned locales within the state of Ohio that the author has paid visits to. They run the gamut from factories, warehouses, and schools to ghost towns, drive-in theaters, and weird houses. Unsurprisingly, these places usually come with ghost legends. Varosha, a quarter of Famagusta on the island of Cyprus. Formerly one of the top resorts in the world, it remained in Turkish hands following Turkey\\'s 1974 invasion of the island, but a UN resolution forbids them from populating it. Only the Turkish military and UN officials are allowed in, and it is tightly guarded, so unlike most abandoned places, it\\'s relatively untouched by urban explorers and vandals. The Fair Company department store in the small town of Union Springs, Alabama. The owners retired in 1992 and, unable to find someone to take over the store, just closed it one summer day, leaving all the merchandise inside. More than 20 years later, it\\'s still abandoned, with everything inside completely intact. Frequently, when a farmer moves off their land, their neighbors will buy them out to extend their crop yield, but do nothing with the buildings left behind. More than a dozen New York City Subway stations and portions of existing stations have been closed and left to rot for several reasons: the MTA\\'s unwillingness to maintain the station, low patronage, and track alterations that rendered portions of a line unusable. Many urban planners view the city-owned Independent Subway System to be inundated with many exits and mezzanines unnecessarily built; some of them were built in anticipation of future expansions that weren\\'t built. Plus, many of the old elevateds were removed because their route was essentially duplicated by a nearby subway line and/or were seen as blighted. Also, while discussion remains strong to this day for the subway\\'s expansion, many of the provisions have largely been ignored due to funding problems or political bickering. Similarly, there are quite a few unused and abandoned stations on the London Underground. Since 2014, the town of Picher, Oklahoma has been officially classified as an abandoned town. Due to a half-century\\'s worth of devastating natural incidents (including, but not limited to, mine cave-ins, toxic contaminants that were kept in piles next to public spaces, groundwater contamination, a massive spike in negative health effects, possible permanent damage due to long-term lead inhalation, and a tornado), the city underwent a forced evacuation in 2006, with most of the remaining residents fleeing after said tornado touched down in 2008. The last surviving resident (and town pharmacist), Gary Linderman, passed away in 2015, and the site has been officially earmarked for future cleanup by the Environmental Protection Association. As it currently stands, though, Picher is uninhabitable and many of its buildings are left in serious disrepair. Countless Drive In Theaters have been left reasonably untouched since their decline in the 1970s and 1980s, and in many cases (particularly in smaller towns), the fixtures have been largely intact. It\\'s not unheard of to find a drive-in \"graveyard\" where the snack bar/projection booth or even the screen is still standing, despite having not been used for a long period of time. In 1968, the Pennsylvania Turnpike was rerouted east of Breezewood, PA in order to bypass the Ray\\'s Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels, two narrow tunnels that created traffic backups. This left a 13-mile stretch of old turnpike abandoned to public use, but still visible to this day. Part of the old turnpike became part of the interchange into Breezewood, which makes an abrupt left turn just before a long since abandoned bridge. The abandoned stretch also includes Cove Valley Travel Plaza, a rest area serving westbound travelers which was torn down after its abandonment. A third tunnel, the Laurel Hill Tunnel west of Somerset, PA, was also bypassed due to traffic demands but remains visible. Six Gun City or as it was last known Fort Jefferson in northern New Hampshire is completely abandoned and overgrown. Even creepier is the fact that the still open Santa\\'s Village is a stone\\'s throw away down the road. No effort has been made to remove anything and all the rides are mostly intact.'"
